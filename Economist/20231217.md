OVER A THOUSAND MILES from Gaza, a naval crisis is unfolding that could transform the war between Israel and Hamas into a global affair with implications for the world economy. 
Since December 15th four of the world’s five largest container-shipping companies, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, Maersk and MSC, have paused or suspended their services in the Red Sea, the route through which traffic from the Suez Canal must pass, as Iran-backed Houthi militants, armed with sophisticated weapons, escalate their attacks on global shipping flows.
 As one of the world’s major trade arteries suddenly closes, America and its allies are ramping 斜坡 up naval activity in the Middle East, and may even attack the Houthis, in order to re-establish free passage.
Bab al-Mandab is a narrow strait between Africa and the Arabian peninsula 半岛through which an estimated 12% of global trade by volume normally flows, and perhaps 30% of global container traffic. It has become a no-go zone as the Houthis, based in Yemen, attack shipping, 
ostensibly in support of the Palestinians in Gaza. 
The strikes have been going on for weeks but have now escalated sharply.
 On December 15th the Houthis threatened to attack one ship, struck another one with a drone and launched two ballistic missiles at the MV Palatium III, one of which hit the vessel. The attack on the Palatium III was the first ever use of an anti-ship ballistic missile.全能导弹 All the ships were Liberian-flagged所有船只都悬挂利比里亚国旗.

Faced with a soaring risk of ships being crippled and their crews killed, the global shipping industry is switching into emergency mode. On December 15th Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd paused their services. On December 16th CMA CGM followed, as did MSC, the owner of the Palatium III, which said that its ships would not use the Suez Canal in either direction “until the Red Sea passage is safe”, and that some vessels would be rerouted via the Cape of Good Hope. Together these four companies account for 53% of the global container trade. 
Smaller container operators, as well as dry-bulk carriers and oil tanker firms, may now follow their lead.

The crisis has two big implications: 影响
one for the world economy and the other regarding the risks of military escalation in the Middle East as Western countries try to re-establish order. Start with the economy. 
Revenue from the Suez Canal is a major source of income for Egypt, which is already in the midst of a financial crisis. (Israel will be less affected, with only about 5% of its trade passing through Eilat, its Red Sea port.) 
For the world economy a prolonged closure of the Suez route would raise the costs of trade as shipping is rerouted around Africa, taking more time, and insurance premiums soar. 
对于世界经济来说，苏伊士运河的长期关闭将提高贸易成本，因为航运在非洲周围改道，需要更多时间，保险费飙升。
Short-term supply-chain snarls could also result from wide-scale rerouting of trade: in 2021 the Ever Given, a Taiwanese-operated ship, ran aground and blocked the canal for six days, intensifying a global supply-chain crunch. If the Red Sea security crisis is perceived to threaten shipping in the nearby Arabian Sea, through which perhaps one-third of global seaborne oil supply passes, the economic costs would be dramatically higher.
These risks are why America and its allies will be inclined to act这些风险是美国及其盟国倾向于采取行动的原因。. But the Houthi threat is a daunting and complex one. The militant group’s motto includes the exhortation “Death to Israel. A curse upon the Jews,” and it claims that it is targeting “all ships heading to Israeli ports” until food and medicine are delivered to Gaza. But most of the ships being attacked are neither headed to Israel nor under Israeli ownership. Countries from around the world are affected: one of the vessels attacked by the Houthis was sailing under a Hong Kong flag.
The apparent incoherence of the Houthis’ stated aims should not be confused with ineffectiveness. 
胡塞武装所宣称的目标明显不连贯不应与无效相混淆。
For years Iran has trained and armed the group in its successful insurgency within Yemen, and in a war against Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Islamic Republic’s regional rivals. The sophistication of some of the weapons involved is high. “The Houthis have a giant anti-ship missile arsenal at this point,” says Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a think-tank in London, including those with ranges of up to 800km.
Western officials are unclear as to whether Iran is directing individual attacks. Israeli intelligence is not yet convinced the latest strikes were sanctioned by the Corps 6000, a unit of Iran’s expeditionary Quds Force that works with the Houthis in a joint command centre. However, the group is thought to receive intelligence on shipping from Iran’s surveillance ships in the Red Sea. And the broad campaign against shipping fits with Iran’s strategy of calibrated pressure, avoiding an all-out attack on Israel while drawing on its regional proxies to harangue it violently from all sides. But Iran does not have complete control over Houthi attacks—and the strikes are dragging in more and more countries.
Diplomacy might help de-escalate the crisis. In 2015 Saudi Arabia and the UAE intervened in Yemen’s civil war in favour of the internationally recognised government. In March 2022 the Saudis agreed to a ceasefire, leaving the Houthis in control of the capital, Sana’a, and the strategic western coast. They may soon announce a road map to make the ceasefire permanent and end the war. Commitments to cease maritime attacks could become part of any talks.
外交可能有助于缓和危机。2015年，沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋干预了也门内战，支持国际公认的政府。2022 年 3 月，沙特同意停火，让胡塞武装控制首都萨那和具有战略意义的西海岸。他们可能很快会宣布一个路线图，使停火永久化并结束战争。停止海上攻击的承诺可以成为任何谈判的一部分。
Nonetheless, a bigger military response to the Houthi threat is likely. A multinational task force led by America’s navy is already operating off the Yemeni coast in order to try to deter the Houthis from forcibly boarding ships—a raid was disrupted in November—and firing missiles. It includes both Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In recent weeks American, British and French warships have all intercepted Houthi drones and missiles, and America has asked Australia to send a warship, too.
尽管如此，对胡塞威胁的军事反应是可能的。由美国海军领导的一支多国特遣部队已经在也门海岸附近开展行动，试图阻止胡塞武装强行登船并发射导弹。它包括埃及和沙特阿拉伯。最近几周，美国、英国和法国的军舰都拦截了胡塞武装的无人机和导弹，美国也要求澳大利亚派出一艘军舰。
But this defensive armada has struggled to keep the crisis under control. The Houthis have demonstrated that a few drones and missiles can always get through. One potential next step involves armed escorts for merchant shipping, which America used in the 1980s during the so-called tanker war between Iran and Iraq. But these require a very large number of warships, according to naval sources involved in the debate.
但是，这支防御性舰队一直在努力控制危机。胡塞武装已经证明，一些无人机和导弹总能通过。一个潜在的下一步涉及为商船提供武装护航，美国在1980年代伊朗和伊拉克之间的所谓油轮战争中使用了这种护航。但据参与辩论的海军消息人士称，这些需要大量的军舰。
The main alternative is to strike the Houthis and their arsenal directly. America and Israel have both developed plans to attack Houthi depots and launchers. 
America will be loth to 会很讨厌 broaden its involvement in the Middle East: the Biden administration had been focused on expanding the Red Sea task force and putting diplomatic and economic pressure on Iran. Israel does not want a new conflict: it is already facing pressure from America to wind down this phase of the Gaza war, and is concerned about Hizbullah, the Lebanese militant group, which has been firing missiles at Israel almost daily. 
主要的选择是直接打击胡塞武装及其军火库。美国和以色列都制定了攻击胡塞武装仓库和发射器的计划。美国将不愿扩大其在中东的参与：拜登政府一直专注于扩大红海特遣部队，并向伊朗施加外交和经济压力。以色列不希望发生新的冲突：它已经面临来自美国的压力，要求结束加沙战争的这一阶段，并对黎巴嫩激进组织真主党感到担忧，该组织几乎每天都在向以色列发射导弹。
Yet if Iran and its Houthi proxies continue attacks that keep one of the world’s major trade routes closed, escalation升级 may be inevitable.
然而，如果伊朗及其胡塞代理人继续发动袭击，使世界主要贸易路线之一关闭，升级可能是不可避免的。
